# The Treehouse Club

Treehouse Club is a unique blogging platform designed for individuals who value privacy but still want to connect with their community. Built with **React**, **MongoDB**, and **Express**, the platform allows users to share content—such as short stories, poems, or research findings—in two distinct ways: anonymously or under their known profile.

## Features

- **Anonymous Posting**: Share posts without revealing your identity. Anonymous posts appear on friends' feeds, fostering a judgment-free environment.
- **Non-Anonymous Posting**: Publish posts under your profile to build your personal brand and gain recognition for your work.
- **Dual-Posting Flexibility**: Choose how you want to share your ideas—discreetly or openly.

## Why Choose Treehouse Club?

This dual-posting feature encourages creativity and open communication, making Treehouse Club the perfect platform for:
- Writers
- Researchers
- Creatives

Share your ideas freely and authentically, without fear of bias or judgment.
